Description of the app and its functionality: 
This is application the web that allow users to store and manage workouts that they find across the web onto thier profile. The users are also able to edit, delete, as well as add various workouts. The workouts include: running, weightlifting, and cycling. The user is able to post a link of the workout video to their user profile.

Background info of the app:
I built this app, because when I was fresh out of college I couldn't afford gym membership or a trainer so I would surf the web looking for different workouts. Whenever I wanted to circle back to that workout, I had a hard time remembering the website and the workout. Being able store all the workouts and link to them on one website would have been very convenient.
